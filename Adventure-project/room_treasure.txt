=== Treasure Vault ===
You've entered the legendary treasure vault! Gold coins are scattered everywhere, and precious gems sparkle in the dim light. 

In the corner, you find:
- A legendary sword that deals 30 damage
- A master key that opens all doors
- A health elixir that restores 100 HP

This is the ultimate reward for your bravery!
